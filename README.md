# Tools for Gossip

BSc Project

## Building

An optimized build of the application can be generated by running `./optimize.sh`. This is based on [this](https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/hints/optimize.md) instruction.

To create a development build with debugging tools, run the following:

```sh
elm make src/Main.elm --debug --output=./dist/elm.js
```

## Running the application

The compiled application lives in `./dist/`. Open `./dist/index.html` to use it!

## Progress

You can track my progress and ideas in my [To Do list](./TODO.md).
