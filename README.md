BSc Project

## Installing

If you want to build this project yourself, you'll need [`yarn`][3] or [`npm`][4]. Optionally, you can also install [`elm-live`][2] if you want to run a development server with live-reload. If you just want to use the project, you can just build it and navigate to `./dist/index.html`.

To install:

```sh
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

## Building and running

Build a release:

```sh
yarn build
# or
npm build
```

Run a live-reload server in **production** mode:

```sh
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

Run a live-reload server in **development** mode:

```sh
yarn start-dev
# or
npm start-dev
```

## Progress

You can track my progress and ideas in my [To Do list](./TODO.md). I keep some notes on what I'm doing and things I discover [here](./NOTES.md).
