ElmGossip is a web tool for exploring and analysing dynamic gossip, built in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org).
The tool is available [online](https://ramonmeffert.github.io/elm-gossip/), or you can follow the [instructions](#running-locally) below to run the tool locally.
In general, we advise using the online version unless you plan to do anything with the source code.

## About

This tool began its life as part of my [bachelor's thesis](https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/23961/).
Since finishing my thesis, I have been working on implementing new features and polishing the tool.

## Features

- üëÅ Visualise gossip graphs
- ‚òéÔ∏è See which calls are allowed for any protocol
- ‚úÖ Validate and execute call sequences
- ‚è∞ Time-travel between multiple graph states after executing calls
- üõ† Create your own custom gossip protocols
- üå≥ Generate execution trees
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Helpful and human-oriented error messages

### In progress

- Successfulness analysis  
  _That is, whether some protocol is weakly/strongly successful on a given graph_
- GraphViz and LaTeX export  
  _Making it easy to use graphs and protocol formulae in other places_
- Saving the state of the tool to LocalStorage  
  _So you don't lose your work when navigating away from the page_
- Saving and loading custom protocols  
  _Transferability!_
- Dark mode  
  _üåö_

You can track the progress of these features on the [issues](https://github.com/RamonMeffert/tools-for-gossip/issues) page.

### Future ideas

- Mobile support
- Turn the site into a Progressive Web App for offline access

## Running locally

If you want to build this project yourself, you'll need [`yarn`][1] or [`npm`][1].

To install:

```sh
yarn install # or npm install
```

## Building and running

If you just want to run the project, you can run a live-reload server in development mode:

```sh
yarn start # or npm start
```

If you want to build a release, you can run the following command:

```sh
yarn build # or npm build
```

This will generate a `docs`<sup>1</sup> directory. You can upload this directory to a web server or run a local web server from this directory (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`) to see the project. Since Elm is compiled to Javascript, uploading the compiled files is all you need to do ‚Äì you don't have to start a web server as everything runs client side.

---

<sup><sup>1</sup> To deploy to GitHub Pages, the folder has to be called `docs`.</sup>
