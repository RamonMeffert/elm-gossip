accross while working on this project.

## Rendering graphs

October 17, 2020

An important part of this project is visualisation. Therefore, it makes sense to take some time to think on how to best do this. In practice, this comes downâ€”at least for a big partâ€”to picking the right library. Before listing the options I am considering, I'll list my considerations in the form of a [MoSCoW][moscow].

### Must-haves

The library...

- Must be able to **render directed graphs** with named nodes and different edge styles
  - By directly interacting with `elm-community/graph`, or
  - By interacting with an output format supported by `elm-community/graph`
- Must be able to render said graph such that the visualisation **updates in real time**, or at least near real time

### Should-haves

The library...

- Should **integrate with Elm**
  - Either directly, or by using Elm's [ports][ports]
- Should be **maintained**
  - That is, it should use modern standards and be updated (somewhat) regularly

### Could-haves

The library...

- Could have a way to **handle user input** to make the visualisation more interactive
  - An extended goal of this project is to increase usability by being more WYSIWYG

### Won't-haves

The library...

- Won't have the need for lots of **additional code in another language**, like Javascript

### Libraries

So far, I have found the following libraries (ordered by when I found them):

- [dagre-d3](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3)
- [d3-graphviz](https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz)
- [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/)
- [elm-visualization](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gampleman/elm-visualization/latest/)
- [typed-svg](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/typed-svg/latest/)
- [graphvizlib.wasm](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/hpcc-js-wasm#graphviz-graphvizlibwasm)

There are, without a doubt, more libraries that can do this, and I'll keep looking for others while working on the project. However, these seem like decent options. I'll go over them one by one to evaluate them, and eventually pick a â€˜winnerâ€™.

#### dagre-d3

##### Pros

- ðŸ˜ƒ Nice looking output
- ðŸ˜ƒ Accepts DOT code as input
- ðŸ˜ƒ When used for DOT code visualisation, requires little extra Javascript
- ðŸ˜ƒ Maintained (Updated less than a year ago)

##### Cons

- ðŸ˜• Does way more than just graph visualisation so might be a bit overkill
- ðŸ˜• Some pretty big dependencies
- ðŸ˜• Using extra features requires Javascript

**Dependencies**: lodash, graphlib, dagre, (maybe d3? It's in the name, but it's not listed)

#### d3-graphviz

##### Pros

- ðŸ˜ƒ Nice looking output
- ðŸ˜ƒ Accepts DOT code as input (i.e. it just works)
- ðŸ˜ƒ Supports animations
- ðŸ˜ƒ Uses a version of GraphViz compiled to WebAssembly, so compatibility guaranteed
- ðŸ˜ƒ Maintained (Updated less than a year ago)

##### Cons

- ðŸ˜• Includes a warning that animations might make things slow

**Dependencies**: d3, graphvizlib.wasm

#### viz.js

Suggested in the `elm-community/graph` documentation, but is deprecated. Suggests using Dagre instead. (see above)

#### elm-visualization

##### Pros

- ðŸ˜ƒ Written in Elm, so integration and interaction is very nice
- ðŸ˜ƒ Actively maintained (Updated about a month ago)
- ðŸ˜ƒ The only real way to make satisfying the could-haves a possibility<sup>1</sup>

##### Cons

- ðŸ˜• Does way more than just graph visualisation so might be a bit overkill
- ðŸ˜• Requires writing some code to render graphs (doesn't work out-of-the-box)

**Dependencies**: (all Elm packages) elm-color, list-extra, one-true-path-experiment, elm-geometry, elm-units-prefixed, time-extra, date-format

#### typed-svg

##### Pros

- ðŸ˜ƒ Written in Elm, so integration and interaction is very nice
- ðŸ˜ƒ Just SVG, so output is extremely flexible and extensible
- ðŸ˜ƒ Also (like `elm-visualization`) allows user interaction

##### Cons

- ðŸ˜• Pretty hardcore: all rendering code has to be implemented from scratch

**Dependencies**: (Elm package) avh4/elm-color

#### graphvizlib.wasm

##### Pros

- ðŸ˜ƒ It's just GraphViz, but on the web

##### Cons

- ðŸ˜• It's just GraphViz, but on the web

**Dependencies**: None

### Conclusion

I want to see if using `elm-visualisation` is feasible, as it allows for best integration and keeps the could-haves achievable. If that doesn't work, I'll probably switch to `d3-graphviz`.

<sup><sup>1</sup>This is _technically_ also possible with some of the javascript libraries, but would require using ports _a lot_, which I frankly would like to avoid if possible</sup>

## Minor annoyances with Elm

October 16, 2020

These thing's don't really matter, but they do bother me a bit. Do note that I still _like_ elm, it's just that sometimes I miss features and/or syntax from other languages.

### Pattern matching

Why is using `case` the only way to do pattern matching? This often causes some pretty deep indentation, especially when following the elm style guidelines (i.e. a newline and added indentation after the `->` symbol).
A good example is when matching sub elements of lists:

```elm
match : List Int -> List Int
match list =
    case list of
        [] ->
            []

        x :: xs ->
            case x of
                1 ->
                    (20 :: match xs)

                2 ->
                    (10 :: match xs)

                _ ->
                    (-1 :: match xs)
```

In Haskell, this would like like this. We can use the fact that you can match patterns in the function definition as well as guards<sup>1</sup> to make the code a lot more compact.

```haskell
match :: [Int] -> [Int]
match [] = []
match (x:xs)
    | x == 1 = (20 : match xs)
    | x == 2 = (10 : match xs)
    | otherwise = (-1 : match xs)
```

See what I mean? In Elm, the `case` statement looks the cleanest to me in most scenarios, but it often does not suffice, leaving you to the `if`-`else` construction that, granted, takes up fewer lines, but does introduce more visual clutter (note how the conditions aren't aligned):

```elm
match : List Int -> List Int
match list =
    case list of
        [] ->
            []

        x :: xs ->
            if x == 1 then
                (20 :: match xs)

            else if x == 2 then
                (10 :: match xs)

            else
                (-1 :: match xs)
```

### Strings and lists

_Why_ aren't strings lists. Every other functional language does this, but in Elm I have to deal with `String.toList` and `String.fromList`.

### Method signatures and concat

_Why_ did Elm feel the need to switch the `:` and `::` operators. Both F# and Haskell, which I think were the main inspirations for Elm, have them the other way around.

### Shorthand (?) lambda functions

This is a really minor nitpick, but I just like writing `filter (==5) [..]` a bit better than `filter (\x -> x == 5) [..]`.

### (Infix) operators

The ability to define infix operators was [removed in Elm 0.19][infix-removed]. Huh. No `(!!)` for me I guess

---

<sup><sup>1</sup> It seems like Elm [used to have guards][guards], but they were removed.</sup>

## Validation

Oct 15, 2020

Just so I don't forget: Elm has a useful `andThen` operator that can be used to chain method calls for validation.
It is somewhat comparable to the `do` notation or the `>>=` operator in Haskell.
By using `andThen`, and implementing `validate` functions for the parsers, validation and parsing could be quite clean.

_A few hours pass_

Actually, in order for this to work, I'll need the [`Result`][result] type.
I'm not yet sure if the validation should be inside the `parse` function or if it should be separate,
but given the way `Result` works, I'm leaning towards inside `parse`.
That is, it'll be a separate function that is called inside the `parse` function, it just won't be exposed.

## Sets

Oct 10, 2020

I've found that `Set`s in Elm are useless if you want to use them for anything other than the types that Elm has predefined to be `comparable` (`Int`, `Float`, ...).
Ideally, I would have used a `Set` to store the agents in the current graph.
However, due to the above limitation, this is not possible -- my `Agent` type alias is a record, which is not `comparable`.
I wish Elm would support type classes. I did come across a [blog post][elm-is-wrong] where the author ran into the same problem.

Guess I'll be using `List` for now.
