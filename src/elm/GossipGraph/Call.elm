{-| Execute a call on a gossip graph

Make sure the caller knows everything the receiver knows and vice versa. Since
knowledge is represented as outgoing edges, we can simply add the outgoing edges
of one agent to the other, making sure no duplicates are created and that
relations are upgraded when necessary (i.e. number -> secret)

Built on `Graph.update` and `IntDict.merge`.
